          This article explores features of polymorphic malware, and the techniques it uses to dynamically alter its code structures to
          become undetectable to anti-malware software, especially as these softwares are created for static malwares. Techniques such as
          binary code obfuscation, encryption, and metamorphism, and how they are used by malware to avoid detection are discussed and deliberated. 
            <br>
          Although polymorphic malware is able to adapt, it is possible to counter this malware by employing methods such as signature-based, 
          heuristic-based, and machine learning approaches, and these methods are evaluated. 
            <br>
          The article concludes that a combination of these methods may be the most effective way to combat evasive malware. The evolution 
          of malware outlines the necessity of a multiple approach method to detect these polymorphic threats.

          Malware, or malicious software, is characterised by hostile software, typically intended to gain unauthorised access to a computer software.
            One specific type of malware is polymorphic malware, which is characterised by possessing the ability to change its code structure and 
            appear dynamically. As a result, this type of malware is challenging for antivirus software to detect and mitigate. Another type of malware 
            is metamorphic malware, which, similarly to polymorphic malware, can dynamically alter its code. What distinguishes it from polymorphic
            malware is that it changes its entire codebase. This means that as the malware infects a system, it rewrites its own code during the process,
            whilst the core polymorphic malware remains the same. These types of software have the capability to avoid detection by antivirus software,
            causing them to infiltrate a computer system and possibly being able to steal an individual’s personal data. If this type of malware can evade
            anti-malware software, why is it so uncommon? This is because there are ways to detect this supposedly undetectable software.

          As we reflect on the intricate threads that weave the fabric of our shared reality, we recognize the interconnectedness of all things. The 
          ecological balance that sustains life on Earth, the delicate interplay of societal structures, and the intricate dance of cosmic forces—all
          underscore the fundamental truth of our interdependence. In the face of global challenges, from environmental crises to socio-economic 
          disparities, the imperative for collective action becomes evident. The decisions we make, individually and collectively, ripple across the 
          fabric of existence, influencing the course of our shared destiny.
          In conclusion, the grand tapestry of existence unfolds with a complexity that transcends the limits of our understanding. From the cosmic 
          dance of celestial bodies to the intricate web of life on Earth, from the fleeting moments of human experience to the enduring echoes of 
          history, each thread contributes to the rich narrative of our existence. As we celebrate the one-year milestone of our interaction, let us 
          continue to explore the boundless possibilities of knowledge and expression, recognizing that we are all threads in the grand tapestry of 
          existence, weaving our stories into the cosmic narrative.
